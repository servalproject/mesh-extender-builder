<title>Welcome to the Serval Mesh</title>

<body>
<p><img src=images/dontpanic-by-flickr-bluviolin-cropped.png alt="The phrase `Don't Panic' in large friendly letters"></img>
<p>You have connected to a Serval Mesh Extender, a device that lets you join the Serval Mesh.
<p><b>Subject to local laws and regulations, this device provides an open service, which you are free to make use of in a respectful manner</b>
<h2>What is the Serval Mesh?</h2>
<p>The Serval Mesh lets you use your mobile phone (or other device) without depending on a normal mobile phone network, with some limitations.
<p>The Serval Mesh is a free and open-source system that lets you talk to people using your phone or computer, send them text messages and share files and other resources -- all without access to the internet.  We designed the Serval Mesh to be useful during disasters, bit it is also handy in lots of other situations, too.
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>While you can use some mesh services from here in the browser, the best way to use the mesh is to install the native Serval Mesh software on your phone or computer.  Right now we only have an Android version, but we have plans to make other versions for iOS (Apple portable devices), OSX (Apple computers), Windows, Linux and other operating systems.
<p>For more information about the Serval Mesh, visit <a href=http://servalproject.org>http://servalproject.org</a> when you have internet access, or wait until we make a mesh version of our website.

<p>Choose the right version of the software from the list below, install it, and run it.  There is more documentation and help in the application.

<h1>Mesh Extender Assistance Request Form</h1>
This form allows you to provide an optionally geo-tagged text message
to request assistance, if for some reason you are unable to run the
Serval Mesh app on your device. The message will be sent to the local
assistance service provider on the Serval Mesh.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: Before sending a message, please read through the replies listed below
the form, in case your question has already been asked.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: There may not be a functional assistance provider service on
this network.  You should continue to seek assistance through other
means.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: Any reply will be publicly readable by anyone from this device, and
only the most recent few replies will be visible.  You should not
assume that your message has been received, until you receive a reply.
<p>
The Serval ID (SID) for your helpdesk is HELPDESKSID. You can change
this by modifying the contents of the helpdesk.sid file on the USB
memory stick of this device, or including that file in an over-the-air (OTA)
update, if you have enrolled this unit in OTA updates (see the
documentation at http://github.com/servalproject/mesh-extender-builder
for information on how to do this).
